# mango-api

A simple node.js API that serves up 137 different mango cultivars in JSON!

All data collected was gathered from Wikipedia using Puppeteer. You can check that repo out [here](https://github.com/Srgiomndz/wiki-scraper)



## Examples

Example endpoint: 

```
https://mango-api.fly.dev/api/kent
```

Returns:

``` yaml
{
  name: "Kent",
  image: "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/Mango_Kent_Asit_fs8.jpg/120px-Mango_Kent_Asit_fs8.jpg",
  origin: "Australia, Brazil, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Israel, Italy, Mexico, South Africa, United States",
  notes: "The original Kent tree still stands in Coral Gables, Florida (United States)"
}
```

## Installation:




## How It's Made:

Some additions that I would like to add are:

add style.css (very bland atm)

add CI/CD with fly.io and github actions for practice!
